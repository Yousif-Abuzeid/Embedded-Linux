# OOP Concepts Summary

## Classes & Objects

### Class

The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object. For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, the Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, and mileage are their properties.

- A Class is a user-defined data type that has data members and member functions.
- Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to manipulate these variables together these data members and member functions define the properties and behavior of the objects in a Class.
- In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage, etc and member functions can apply brakes, increase speed, etc.

We can say that a Class in C++ is a blueprint representing a group of objects which shares some common properties and behaviors.

### Object

An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

```cpp
// C++ Program to show the syntax/working of Objects as a
// part of Object Oriented PProgramming
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class person {
    char name[20];
    int id;

public:
    void getdetails() {}
};

int main()
{

    person p1; // p1 is a object
    return 0;
}
```

### Access Modifiers

- Public: Members declared as public can be accessed from outside the class.
- Private: Members declared as private can only be accessed within the class itself.
- Protected: Members declared as protected can be accessed within the class and by derived classes.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation in C++ is defined as the wrapping up of data and information in a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.

### Two Important  property of Encapsulation

- Data Protection: Encapsulation protects the internal state of an object by keeping its data members private. Access to and modification of these data members is restricted to the classâ€™s public methods, ensuring controlled and secure data manipulation.

- Information Hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of a class from external code. Only the public interface of the class is accessible, providing abstraction and simplifying the usage of the class while allowing the internal implementation to be modified without impacting external code.
