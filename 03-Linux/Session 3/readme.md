### vi or vim or nvim

#### Vim Modes

Vim, a highly configurable text editor, operates through different modes, each serving a specific purpose for editing and interacting with files. Here's a breakdown of the primary modes in Vim:

##### 1. Normal Mode (Command Mode)
- **Purpose**: This is the default mode when you open Vim, and itâ€™s used for navigating and issuing commands.
- **Common actions**:
  - Move the cursor: `h` (left), `j` (down), `k` (up), `l` (right).
  - Delete text: `dd` (delete line), `x` (delete character).
  - Copy and paste: `yy` (yank/copy), `p` (paste).
- **Enter this mode**: Press `Esc` from any other mode.

##### 2. Insert Mode
- **Purpose**: Used for entering or editing text.
- **Common actions**:
  - Type normally to insert text.
  - Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode.
- **Enter this mode**: Press `i` (insert before cursor), `I` (insert at the beginning of the line), `a` (insert after cursor), or `A` (insert at the end of the line).

##### 3. Visual Mode
- **Purpose**: Used for selecting text to perform operations like copying, deleting, or replacing.
- **Common actions**:
  - Select text by moving the cursor.
  - Perform operations: `d` (delete), `y` (copy), or `r` (replace).
- **Enter this mode**: Press `v` (character-wise selection), `V` (line-wise selection), or `Ctrl+v` (block selection).

##### 4. Command-Line Mode
- **Purpose**: Used for running Vim commands, like saving or quitting.
- **Common actions**:
  - `:w` (write/save file), `:q` (quit), `:wq` (save and quit), `:q!` (quit without saving).
  - You can also search using `/` (forward search) or `?` (backward search).
- **Enter this mode**: Press `:` (colon) for commands or `/` for search.

##### 5. Replace Mode
- **Purpose**: Used to replace existing text with new text.
- **Common actions**:
  - Replaces characters one at a time as you type.
  - Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode.
- **Enter this mode**: Press `R` from Normal mode.

##### 6. Select Mode (Less common)
- **Purpose**: Similar to Visual Mode, but selections act like a typical text editor.
- **Common actions**:
  - Select text and immediately replace it by typing.
- **Enter this mode**: Press `g` followed by `v`.

##### Switching between modes:
- Use `Esc` to switch back to Normal mode from other modes.
- Commands like `i`, `v`, `R`, and `:` help transition between modes.

Each mode has its own distinct role, making Vim powerful for both text editing and efficient navigation.

### gedit (GUI)

- A simple text editor for GNOME desktop environment
- Syntax: `gedit [OPTION]... [FILE]...`

## Controls

### Redirectors

#### > (Output Redirection)

- Redirects the output of a command to a file
- Syntax: `command > file`

```bash

ls > file1.txt

cat file1.txt> file2.txt

```

#### >> (Append)

- Appends the output of a command to a file
- Syntax: `command >> file`

```bash

ls >> file1.txt

cat file1.txt >> file2.txt

```

#### < (Input Redirection)

- Redirects the input of a command from a file
- Syntax: `command < file`

```bash


cat < file1.txt

```

#### 2> (Error Redirection)

- Redirects the error output of a command to a file
- Can be used to redirect the standard error output to a file

- Syntax: `command 2> file`

```bash

g++ file.cpp && ./a.out 2> error.txt> log.txt
// Redirects the error output to error.txt and the standard output to log.txt

```

#### 2>> (Error Append)

- Appends the error output of a command to a file
- Syntax: `command 2>> file`

```bash

g++ file.cpp && ./a.out 2>> error.txt>> log.txt
// Appends the error output to error.txt and the standard output to log.txt

```

### Piping

- Connects the output of one command to the input of another command

- Syntax: `command1 | command2`

```bash

ls | grep file

```

### Wildcards


- Wildcards are characters used to match filenames.
- Wildcards are used with commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, etc.

#### Types of Wildcards

- `*` -> Matches zero or more characters.

#### Special patterns

- `.` -> Matches a single character.
- `..` -> Matches two characters.
- `~` -> Matches the home directory.
- `*` -> Matches zero or more characters.
